# Network-Design Group Project
## Design of Local Area Network - University of Moratuwa Backbone and ENTC Building

In this group project, we have undertaken the task of designing the backbone network for the University of Moratuwa (UOM) and the internal network of one of its key buildings, the Faculty of Engineering (ENTC). Our goal is to create a robust and scalable network infrastructure that will serve the university's needs for the next 20-25 years, considering cost-effectiveness and best practices in network design.

### Backbone Network Design Approach:
For the backbone network, we have chosen a hierarchical topology, specifically a modified three-tier architecture. This topology offers scalability, redundancy, and efficient traffic management. The core layer will connect all major buildings on campus, the distribution layer will handle inter-building connections, and the access layer will serve individual departments and offices within each building. This approach provides clear separation between core and edge devices, ensuring efficient traffic routing and minimal downtime.

### Network Diagram:
Please refer to the attached network diagram, which illustrates all UOM buildings, their interconnections, and bandwidth allocation for each link. This network diagram will be used as a basis for routing simulations.

### IP Addressing Scheme:
We have developed an IP addressing scheme for both IPv4. Each building will be assigned a dedicated subnet to ensure efficient IP management and scalability.

### Selection of Active and Passive Components:

For our backbone network, we have selected single-mode fiber optic cables for long-term reliability and high bandwidth capabilities. We have chosen high-capacity routers and switches to accommodate future growth. Our selection of active components is based on a careful analysis of UOM's current and anticipated network requirements.

### Router and Switch Specifications:

Detailed specifications of routers and switches, including their capacity, redundancy features, and support for IPv6, are outlined in the attached documentation.

### Bill of Quantities:

We have prepared a Bill of Quantities for both passive and active components based on observations from the ENTC network. This BOQ includes a detailed breakdown of costs for cabling, patch panels, routers, switches, and other necessary components.

### Simulation Results:

We have conducted network simulations using GNS3 and Cisco Packet Tracer to validate our design. The simulation files are attached for your reference.

In conclusion, our network design for the University of Moratuwa's backbone and the ENTC building is a comprehensive solution that takes into account long-term sustainability, scalability, and cost-efficiency. We believe this design will serve as a solid foundation for UOM's network infrastructure needs in the coming decades.
